1. Where's the exe file?
	open "x64 file" -> "Debug" -> "Game Dev proj.exe" (this should works)
2. What if it didn't works?
	a. watch the Flappy Bird vid demo.mp4
	b. open the Project1.sln and try to run it from there

I had commented the code I wrote on"Project1.sln" for us to be fully understand how the code works
Open the "Readme 1 - Flowchart" if you want to know more about the big picture of the game
Open the "Readme 2 - Flappy Bird" if you want to know more about the flappy bird game
